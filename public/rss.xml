How to make sure your code follows the rules for accessibility

### Installation

Please install screen reader on your device. We recommend
NVDA
(Windows), VoiceOver
(MacOS and iOS) and TalkBack (Android).
Once it is installed, start the NVDA application and you are ready to go with your screen
reader.

### Introduction

An example of accessibility would be any content or functionality that is fully available to
and usable by people with disabilities.

Slack channel for Accessibility:
a11y-community
WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.0 guidelines are categorized into three
levels of conformance in order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations:
A (lowest), AA (mid-range), and AAA (highest).
We at least follow WCAG AA throughout our application and WCAG AAA whenever asked
for.

Our app should follow at least the below mentioned criteria’s:

1.  Every form control has an associate label:
    [link](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/developing/#associate-a-label-with-every-form-control)
2.  Alt Attributes are present for all images, regardless of being empty of not:
    Approach: Ensure that alternative text for images is added to all informational and
    functional images. Use empty alternative text, alt="" for decorative images, or include
    them in the CSS instead. Text alternatives are usually provided by those responsible
    for written content.
    [link](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/developing/#include-alternative-text-for-images)
3.  Language of page and language of parts are identified:

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.

## On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

- This however showed weasel
- Well uncritical so misled
  - this is very interesting
- Goodness much until that fluid owl

When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

1.  So baboon this
2.  Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey
3.  Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung
4.  Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic
    impassive fruitlessly shut

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rhetoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole
and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects
again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using
her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and

#### Slapped cozy a that lightheartedly and far

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it
